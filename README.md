Hey developers! 

**RbxEnv** is a lightweight framework designed for variable sharing and codebase organization. As it's known using that `_G.` and `SHARED` is a bad practice, I've often found myself wanting to create variables that can be shared between scripts in the game. I didn't like declaring the same variables in almost every script for assets and wanted a framework that allows you to declare global variables and handle them in a much organized manner.

Though this can be achieved through module scripts, I decided to create a framework dedicated to this purpose as a passion project. This project was something I contributed to in my free time and I'm open sourcing it now that I'm pretty much finished with it's core functionality if anybody wants to add on to it or suggest potential use cases.
