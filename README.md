# RbxEnv

I'm **Carbon (@0Enum)** and I've been a programmer on this platform for roughly 4 years now. 

I pursued this as a passion project to help solve a few problems I faced while coding. Considering using global scopes such as _G. or SHARED and found no other alternative to create shared variables other than setting up an entire module script, I decided to work on a framework that enables programmers to create shared variables that offers a more organized codebase. 

This framework is in its early days of development. Any issues or lack of documentation on certain aspects of the framework can be brought to me attention via my DevForum post or a **PM** on the DevForum.

If you would like to contact me regarding proper use, ideas or anything relating to RbxEnv, you may contact me via the **DevForum (@0Enum)**.
